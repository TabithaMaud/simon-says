# Simon Says Pick A Color

## Project 1 Proposal

### Description

My app is called Simon Says Pick A Color. It's a game for players to test their memory skills. The game will start with one of four colors lighting up, this will be the color the player needs to remember to click. The second round the first color will light up again followed by a new color. The player will then need to remember the order of the two colors and click them in the correct sequence. Each new level one new color will be added to the end of the sequence.

Each time a player makes a correct selection their score will increase by one, which will be displayed on a scoreboard. This will also be a space to hold the player's current high score.

I'd like to include symbols and sound if possible for each selection, as both could make the game more accessible and engaging.
